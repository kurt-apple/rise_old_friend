# rise_old_friend
A tool to make old Arch systems up to date again.
I often forget to update my PGP keyring when I log into an old system. This tool simply downloads the updated keyring before performing the full system update. More functionality may be adder, and at that time I will update this README.

to use:
```
wget https://github.com/kurt-apple/rise_old_friend/rise_old_friend.sh
chmod a+x rise_old_friend.sh
bash rise_old_friend.sh
```
